///
/// The app has one active session, so a 401 arriving for a request made under a *previous*
/// account will eventually be validated — and when that validation comes back invalid, the
/// naive behaviour is to clear whatever is signed in now. That signs out the wrong person: the
/// user is mid-way through using the app as themselves and a leftover request from before
/// their last sign-in silently logs them out.
///
/// [AuthController.checkToken] fences on both the controller's generation and the identity of the
/// token it was asked about, so the clear is dropped unless the very session that was validated
/// is still current. Nothing tested that, and it is the kind of guard a refactor removes
